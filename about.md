<p style="text-align: justify;">
    I am a PhD student at <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">UT Austin</a>, working under the supervision of 
	Professor <a href="https://www.caee.utexas.edu/prof/kallivokas/">Loukas Kallivokas</a>
	in the <a href="https://www.caee.utexas.edu/muse/">MUSE Lab</a> within the 
	<a href="https://www.caee.utexas.edu/">Department of Civil Engineering</a>.
	Additionally, I am pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Computational Science, Engineering, and Mathematics 
	at the <a href="https://www.oden.utexas.edu/">Oden Institute for Computational Engineering & Sciences</a> 
	under the supervision of Professors <a href="https://www.caee.utexas.edu/prof/kallivokas/">Loukas Kallivokas</a> 
	and <a href="https://users.oden.utexas.edu/~omar/">Omar Ghattas</a>.
	<br><br>
	While at IIT Madras, I worked with Professor <a href="https://home.iitm.ac.in/subhadeep/index.htm">Subhadeep Banerjee</a> 
	on my M.Tech project focusing on liquefaction analysis, encompassing cyclic triaxial tests 
	and subsequent numerical analysis. Subsequently, I worked under Professor 
	<a href="https://civil.iitm.ac.in/faculty/saran/">Saravanan Umakanthan</a> 
	in the Department of Structural Engineering, developing Numerical Techniques 
	for boundary value problems. This involved converting MATLAB to C++ for 
	parallel computation to solve a 2D truss problem using the Finite Element Method (FEM).
	<br><br>
	During my undergraduate studies, I worked on two significant projects under the guidance of
	Professor <a href="https://appmech.nitk.ac.in/faculty/lakshman-nandagiri">Lakshman Nandagiri</a>.
	One project involved the development of flow duration curves for the Krishna basin. 
	In the other project, I focused on calculating extreme climate indices of the Kaveri Basin 
	using Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope analyses.
